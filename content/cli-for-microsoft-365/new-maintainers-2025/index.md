We're excited to announce that **Martin Machacek** is joining CLI for Microsoft 365 as a maintainer!

## CLI for Microsoft 365 - more than just a tool

Over the years, CLI for Microsoft 365 has grown from a small idea into a cross-platform tool used daily by thousands of admins and developers. With hundreds of commands and a vibrant community, it has become a project that many rely on to get their work done faster and easier.

But more than the tool itself, it’s the people behind it that make it special. Every contribution—big or small—shapes the CLI into what it is today.

To continue moving forward, we’ve invited **Martin Machacek** to join the maintainers team.

## Looking back, moving forward

While we welcome Martin, we also want to take a moment to recognize **Patrick Lamber** and **Rabia Williams**, who stepped down from their maintainer roles some time ago. Although we never officially shared it until now, both Patrick and Rabia played a huge role in shaping the CLI. Their energy, knowledge, and dedication left a strong foundation that we continue to build on today.  

We owe them a big thank you and are grateful for the time and passion they gave to this project. Their impact remains part of the CLI’s DNA.

## Achieve more together

Martin has already been actively contributing to the CLI, sharing improvements, ideas, and helping unblock others. We’re thrilled to have him join as a maintainer and can’t wait to keep building the future of CLI for Microsoft 365 together.  

The CLI thrives because of the community around it. Whether you contribute code, raise an issue, or simply use the CLI in your work—you’re part of this journey. Together, we achieve more!
